    "# Stateful vs. Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No memory** of previous interactions\n",
    "* Each operation is **independent** and self-contained\n",
    "* Same input **always produces the same output** (deterministic)\n",
    "* No internal state that changes over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stateful\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maintains information** about previous interactions\n",
    "* Operations can **depend on history** and context\n",
    "* Same input may produce **different outputs** based on current state\n",
    "* Has internal state that **changes over time**, or depends on **external state** (e.g., sessions, databases)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Python Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pure Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "add_numbers(5, 3)  # Always returns 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateless Calculator:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate(operation, x, y):\n",
    "    if operation == \"add\":\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "    elif operation == \"multiply\":\n",
    "        return x * y\n",
    "\n",
    "calculate(\"add\", 10, 5)      # 15\n",
    "calculate(\"multiply\", 4, 3)  # 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateful\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counter with Memory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.count = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def increment(self):\n",
    "        self.count += 1\n",
    "        return self.count\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = Counter()\n",
    "counter.increment()  # 1\n",
    "counter.increment()  # 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bank Account:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, balance=0):\n",
    "        self.balance = balance\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self.balance += amount\n",
    "        return self.balance\n",
    "\n",
    "account = BankAccount(100)\n",
    "account.deposit(50)  # 150\n",
    "account.deposit(30)  # 180\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal vs. External State\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to distinguish between **internal state** (within the component) and **external state** (maintained outside, but still changes behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal State:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.count = 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def increment(self):\n",
    "        self.count += 1\n",
    "        return self.count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### External State Dependency:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_user_profile(user_id):\n",
    "    # Output may change if the database is updated\n",
    "    return database.fetch_user(user_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_shopping_cart(session_id):\n",
    "    return session_store.get_cart(session_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:**\n",
    "A function can *appear* stateless but still be stateful if it depends on an external, mutable source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST API Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET /users/123` seems stateless but depends on backend state (database)\n",
    "* If user 123 updates their profile, the *same request* yields different results\n",
    "* REST APIs are **designed to be stateless**, but real-world implementations may behave otherwise due to authentication or data dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateless:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HTTP Protocol** → Each request contains all needed info\n",
    "* **REST APIs** → Stateless by design, but real-world use may introduce state (e.g., sessions, database changes)\n",
    "* **Pure Functions** → No side effects or memory\n",
    "* **Serverless Functions** → AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stateful:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TCP Connections** → Maintains session state\n",
    "* **Database Transactions** → Track state over multiple queries\n",
    "* **User Sessions** → Login state, shopping cart memory\n",
    "* **WebSocket Connections** → Persistent communication with history\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Easier to test → Predictable and repeatable\n",
    "* ✅ Scalable → Any server can process the request\n",
    "* ✅ Simple to debug → No hidden context\n",
    "* ✅ Thread-safe → No shared state\n",
    "* ✅ Cacheable → Output only depends on input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ❌ Limited capability → No memory or workflow\n",
    "* ❌ No personalization → Can't recall user state\n",
    "* ❌ Repetitive → Context must be re-sent every time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateful\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Rich user experience → Can remember and adapt\n",
    "* ✅ Enables complex interactions → Multi-step workflows\n",
    "* ✅ Efficient data use → No need to resend all data each time\n",
    "* ✅ Better real-world modeling → Closer to how entities behave\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* ❌ Harder to scale → Requires sticky sessions or central stores\n",
    "* ❌ Complex testing → Requires setup/teardown for state\n",
    "* ❌ More memory usage → State must be stored\n",
    "* ❌ Debugging challenges → Hidden state = hard-to-trace bugs\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Impact on Software Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stateless** → Microservices, functional programming, serverless\n",
    "* **Stateful** → Monoliths, interactive systems, client-side UIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stateless** → Easy load balancing and scaling\n",
    "* **Stateful** → Requires session management, sticky sessions, or external stores (e.g., Redis)"
